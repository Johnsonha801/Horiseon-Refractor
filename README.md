# Horiseon Refractor
Refactor the starter code to follow a semantic structure to current HTML and CSS standards. I modified the index.html and style.css provided by my bootcamp. By consolidating the css. Removing multiple duplicate classes and styles. Leaving the code more clean and also added comments for easy navigation.
